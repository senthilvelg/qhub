The base has an abstract design with a combination of turquoise and pink colors, and it appears to be made of ceramic with a speckled finish. The lamp has a brass or gold-colored stem leading up to the shade. The lampshade itself is a rectangular box shape, colored in a warm, light tan or yellow with a unique spiral pattern in purple lines, giving it a retro feel. The lamp has a soft, warm glow that adds to its classic, nostalgic aesthetic."
